# Machine-Learning

Modules and tools for a multivariate analysis

## Setup

It is necessary to change `law.cfg`, `luigi.cfg`, `hwwenv.sh`, `setup.sh` and `MSSM_HWW.yaml` to your personal paths and
environment variables!  

First setup software and environment variables for preprocessing up to the ROOT to numpy conversion:

1. `cd tasks`
2. `bash install_lx3b.sh` (only once)
3. `. setup.sh` (in every new shell)
4. `. hwwenv.sh` (in every new shell)

Now you are ready to go!

## Preprocessing

First you need to create the trainingset. This step is handled by law (based on luigi)
For this you need to initialize all law tasks:

1. `law db`

Now you can check the status of the trainingset creation:

2. `law run MergeTrainingset --CreateTrainingset-workflow local --print-status 1`

Open a second shell, setup everything and start a central scheduler via: `luigid`  
Now you can open your browser and open `localhost:8082`. Afterwards you can start the task in the previous shell:

3. `law run MergeTrainingset --CreateTrainingset-workflow local --workers 4`

The number of workers can also be changed during the running task in the central scheduler. If you omit the option
`--CreateTrainingset-workflow local` the task `CreateTrainingset` will be submitted to the HTCondor batch system.
Once the task is finished you can convert the merged trainingset to numpy arrays:

4. `law run NumpyConversion --workers 4`

Also here the number of workers can be changed with the central scheduler.

## Training

Once the preprocessing step is done, you can start the training. Here it is recommended to use a GPU (for RWTH see the wiki of this repo). More details in the wiki...

Local training can be run with:

* `python training/train.py`

For the training submission on the RZ cluster of RWTH, see [here](https://github.com/CMSAachen3B/Machine-Learning/wiki/GPU-Batch-System). An example `.submit` script can be found in the `utils` directory of this repository.

## Evaluation

For a single file:

* `python evaluation/keras_evaluation.py --file test.root --tree latino`

For all files (at RWTH Aachen via HTCondor):

* `python evaluation/process.py`

In order to evaluate only data, wjets or MC files use the option `--datasets`.
More information on script usage with `--help`  

The status of the jobs can be checked with:

1. `python evaluation/condor_status.py`
2. `condor_q [--long]`

After the jobs finished, check if a job failed with:  

* `python utils/checkJobs.py --log-dir <path/to/condor_logs>`  

If a job failed, check the corresponding `.error` file for the problem. Sometimes (very rarely) it happens that a ROOT file gets damaged. This one can check with:  

* `python utils/checkZombie.py --dir <path/to/ntuples>`  

If that happens, just copy the file again from the HWW group and resubmit the job!
